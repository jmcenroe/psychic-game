## Instructions
The computer will randomly choose a letter from the alphabet. 
The goal is for you to guess that letter by pressing a key on the keyboard. 

You are allowed 9 chances to guess the correct letter. 
Your incorrect guesses are displayed after "Your guesses so far:".

You can only guess letters from a to z. Repeating previous guesses don't count against you. 

Each time you guess a letter correctly, your win count increases by one, and the game restarts with a new random letter chosen by the computer.
If you fail to guess the correct letter in 9 chances, your losses count increases by one.

Each time you win or lose, the game will restart without reloading the page.
